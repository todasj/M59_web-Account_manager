Account Manager website for Meridian 59 servers
***************************************************************************

GETTING STARTED
==============================

1.
***
Open your blakserv.cfg in your server folder and under [Socket] add these lines

MaintenancePort		XXX
MaintenanceMask		127.0.0.1

You can use whatever port you want, just make sure you open the port in your firewall/router.
The maintenancemask is the IP to the webserver running this script, this makes sure only scripts from that webserver can preform commands on your server.

2.
***
Create database

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `m59_web` (
  `ID` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Email` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `Username` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `Password` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `IP` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `Built` varchar(1) NOT NULL,
  `Activation` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=0 ;

3.
***
In the functions.php in the script add info to your database so the script can connect and add the info for your server

$m59_server = '127.0.0.1'; <- This is the IP to your server
$m59_port = 'XXX'; <- this should be the MaintenancePort you chosen to use in the blakserv.cfg

4.
***
in .\blakserv\adminfn.c in the server source remove line 1750->1755
to make the server only show account by their accountname when using 'show account XXX', otherwise it could cause problems if users are using only digits in their username like '1'

==============================

If you have done all correctly it should be working. You may want to add already existing account for example admin accounts manually in the database,
to prevent users from trying to make accounts with the same username.

If you have added the GetRealIntellect function from my PvP-fork of Meridian 59 you can uncomment line 27 in 'login.php' and comment line 28. I made this to avoid problems if users
would decide to get soldier shields or god gifts to boost their intellect to gain more levels..
